            <p>I'm currently studying the designing of electrically powered systems and communication networks at FEUP, an engineering school in my home country, Portugal.</p>
            <p>I am passionate about technology and electronics and I am particularly interested in knowing more about programming, robotics and IT. Furthermore, I am fascinated by musical composition, modern physics and medicine.</p>
            <p>I have been busy looking for topics like robot-assisted surgery and Internet security. Additionally, I sporadically attend informally some classes in my college searching and exchanging new ideas with other engineering students, looking to improve and share my knowledge in fields like circuits and programming.</p>
