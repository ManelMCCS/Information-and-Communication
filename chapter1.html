    <h3>1.1 what is the Internet?</h3>
        <p>The Internet is a computer network that interconnects hundreds of millions of com-puting devices throughout the world.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the term computer networkis beginning to sound a bit dated, given the many nontraditional devices that are being hooked up to the Internet. In Internet jar-gon, all of these devices are called hostsorend systems. </p>
        <p>End systems are connected together by a network of communication linksandpacket switches. </p>
        <p>End systems are connected together by a network of communication linksandpacket switches. We’ll see in Section 1.2 that there are many types of communica-tion links, which are made up of different types of physical media, including coaxialcable, copper wire, optical fiber, and radio spectrum. Different links can transmitdata at different rates, with the transmission rateof a link measured in bits/second.When one end system has data to send to another end system, the sending end sys-tem segments the data and adds header bytes to each segment. The resulting pack-ages of information, known as packetsin the jargon of computer networks, are thensent through the network to the destination end system, where they are reassembledinto the original data.</p>

        <h4>1.4.1 Overview of Delay in Packet-Switched Networks</h4>
            
            <p>Recall that a packet starts in a host (the source), passes through a series of routers,and ends its journey in another host (the destination). As a packet travels from onenode (host or router) to the subsequent node (host or router) along this path, the packet suffers from several types of delays at eachnode along the path. The mostimportant of these delays are the nodal processing delay, queuing delay, transmission delay,andpropagation delay; together, these delays accumulate to give a totalnodal delay. The performance of many Internet applications—such as search, Webbrowsing, email, maps, instant messaging, and voice-over-IP—are greatly affectedby network delays. In order to acquire a deep understanding of packet switching andcomputer networks, we must understand the nature and importance of these delays. </p> 
            
        <h5>Types of Delay</h5> 
        
            Let’s explore these delays in the context of Figure 1.16. As part of its end-to-endroute  between  source  and  destination,  a  packet  is  sent  from  the  upstream  nodethrough router A to router B. Our goal is to characterize the nodal delay at router A.Note that router A has an outbound link leading to router B. This link is preceded bya queue (also known as a buffer). When the packet arrives at router A from theupstream node, router A examines the packet’s header to determine the appropriateoutbound link for the packet and then directs the packet to this link. In this example,the outbound link for the packet is the one that leads to router B. A packet can betransmitted on a link only if there is no other packet currently being transmitted onthe link and if there are no other packets preceding it in the queue; if the link is currently busy or if there are other packets already queued for the link, the newlyarriving packet will then join the queue.Processing DelayThe time required to examine the packet’s header and determine where to direct thepacket is part of the processing delay. The processing delay can also include otherfactors, such as the time needed to check for bit-level errors in the packet that occurredin transmitting the packet’s bits from the upstream node to router A.

            1.4•DELAY, LOSS, AND THROUGHPUT IN PACKET-SWITCHED NETWORKS37in high-speed routers are typically on the order of microseconds or less. After thisnodal processing, the router directs the packet to the queue that precedes the link torouter B. (In Chapter 4 we’ll study the details of how a router operates.)Queuing DelayAt the queue, the packet experiences a queuing delayas it waits to be transmitted ontothe link. The length of the queuing delay of a specific packet will depend on the num-ber of earlier-arriving packets that are queued and waiting for transmission onto thelink. If the queue is empty and no other packet is currently being transmitted, then ourpacket’s queuing delay will be zero. On the other hand, if the traffic is heavy and manyother packets are also waiting to be transmitted, the queuing delay will be long. Wewill see shortly that the number of packets that an arriving packet might expect to findis a function of the intensity and nature of the traffic arriving at the queue. Queuingdelays can be on the order of microseconds to milliseconds in practice.Transmission DelayAssuming that packets are transmitted in a first-come-first-served manner, as is com-mon in packet-switched networks, our packet can be transmitted only after all thepackets that have arrived before it have been transmitted. Denote the length of thepacket by Lbits, and denote the transmission rate of the link from router A to routerB by Rbits/sec. For example, for a 10 Mbps Ethernet link, the rate is R= 10 Mbps;for a 100 Mbps Ethernet link, the rate is R= 100 Mbps. The transmission delayisL/R.This is the amount of time required to push (that is, transmit) all of the packet’sbits into the link. Transmission delays are typically on the order of microseconds tomilliseconds in practice.Propagation DelayOnce  a  bit  is  pushed  into  the  link,  it  needs  to  propagate  to  router  B.  The  timerequired to propagate from the beginning of the link to router B is the propagationdelay. The bit propagates at the propagation speed of the link. The propagationspeed depends on the physical medium of the link (that is, fiber optics, twisted-paircopper wire, and so on) and is in the range of2108meters/sec to 3108meters/secwhich is equal to, or a little less than, the speed of light. The propagation delay isthe distance between two routers divided by the propagation speed. That is, thepropagation delay is d/s,wheredis the distance between router A and router B and sis the propagation speed of the link. Once the last bit of the packet propagates tonode B, it and all the preceding bits of the packet are stored in router B. The whole
            process then continues with router B now performing the forwarding. In wide-areanetworks, propagation delays are on the order of milliseconds.Comparing Transmission and Propagation DelayNewcomers to the field of computer networking sometimes have difficulty under-standing the difference between transmission delay and propagation delay. The differ-ence is subtle but important. The transmission delay is the amount of time required forthe router to push out the packet; it is a function of the packet’s length and the trans-mission rate of the link, but has nothing to do with the distance between the tworouters. The propagation delay, on the other hand, is the time it takes a bit to propagatefrom one router to the next; it is a function of the distance between the two routers, buthas nothing to do with the packet’s length or the transmission rate of the link.An analogy might clarify the notions of transmission and propagation delay. Con-sider a highway that has a tollbooth every 100 kilometers, as shown in Figure 1.17.You can think of the highway segments between tollbooths as links and the toll-booths as routers. Suppose that cars travel (that is, propagate) on the highway at arate of 100 km/hour (that is, when a car leaves a tollbooth, it instantaneously accel-erates to 100 km/hour and maintains that speed between tollbooths). Suppose nextthat 10 cars, traveling together as a caravan, follow each other in a fixed order. Youcan think of each car as a bit and the caravan as a packet. Also suppose that eachtollbooth services (that is, transmits) a car at a rate of one car per 12 seconds, andthat it is late at night so that the caravan’s cars are the only cars on the highway.Finally, suppose that whenever the first car of the caravan arrives at a tollbooth, itwaits at the entrance until the other nine cars have arrived and lined up behind it.(Thus the entire caravan must be stored at the tollbooth before it can begin to be for-warded.) The time required for the tollbooth to push the entire caravan onto thehighway is (10 cars)/(5 cars/minute) = 2 minutes. This time is analogous to thetransmission delay in a router. The time required for a car to travel from the exit ofone tollbooth to the next tollbooth is 100 km/(100 km/hour) = 1 hour. This time isanalogous to propagation delay. Therefore, the time from when the caravan is storedin front of a tollbooth until the caravan is stored in front of the next tollbooth is thesum of transmission delay and propagation delay—in this example, 62 minutes.38CHAPTER 1    •COMPUTER NETWORKS AND THE INTERNETTen-carcaravanTollboothTollbooth100 km100 kmFigure 1.17Caravan analogy
            1.4•DELAY, LOSS, AND THROUGHPUT IN PACKET-SWITCHED NETWORKS39Let’s explore this analogy a bit more. What would happen if the tollbooth servicetime for a caravan were greater than the time for a car to travel between tollbooths?For example, suppose now that the cars travel at the rate of 1,000 km/hour and the toll-booth services cars at the rate of one car per minute. Then the traveling delay betweentwo tollbooths is 6 minutes and the time to serve a caravan is 10 minutes. In this case,the first few cars in the caravan will arrive at the second tollbooth before the last carsin the caravan leave the first tollbooth. This situation also arises in packet-switchednetworks—the first bits in a packet can arrive at a router while many of the remainingbits in the packet are still waiting to be transmitted by the preceding router.If a picture speaks a thousand words, then an animation must speak a millionwords. The companion Web site for this textbook provides an interactive Java appletthat nicely illustrates and contrasts transmission delay and propagation delay. Thereader is highly encouraged to visit that applet. [Smith 2009] also provides a veryreadable discussion of propagation, queueing, and transmission delays.If we let dproc,dqueue,dtrans, and dpropdenote the processing, queuing, transmis-sion, and propagation delays, then the total nodal delay is given bydnodal=dproc+dqueue+dtrans+dpropThe contribution of these delay components can vary significantly. For example,dpropcan be negligible (for example, a couple of microseconds) for a link connect-ing two routers on the same university campus; however, dpropis hundreds of mil-liseconds for two routers interconnected by a geostationary satellite link, and can bethe dominant term in dnodal. Similarly, dtranscan range from negligible to significant.Its contribution is typically negligible for transmission rates of 10 Mbps and higher(for example, for LANs); however, it can be hundreds of milliseconds for largeInternet packets sent over low-speed dial-up modem links. The processing delay,dproc,  is  often  negligible;  however,  it  strongly  influences  a  router’s  maximumthroughput, which is the maximum rate at which a router can forward packets
